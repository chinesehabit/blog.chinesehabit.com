Here's a bunch of links I found useful while learning Chinese!

I know there's a lot here, so I'll start with my **TOP 3**

1. [pleco](https://www.pleco.com/) - Absolutely essential **dictionary** for anyone studying Chinese.

2. [italki](https://www.italki.com/) - Great for **finding a chinese teacher** (and at a decent price).

3. [hsk](https://mandrinacademy.blogspot.com/) - You can choose any **textbook** series you like! I want to take the standard test some day so I use HSK.
